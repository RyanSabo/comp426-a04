In this assignment, I used the textcortex API that I became familiar with in Comp 433. I decided to use the translate and autocomplete text APIs. I made an account to create an API key on textcortex, and you can do the same to run this assignment. Overall the application is simple, a user can either choose to enter an english sentece to translate to spanish or enter an incomplete sentence and get an autocompleted response. Here are the links for more info:
